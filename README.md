## LAB Day 01. Fundamentals

### Introduction 

The aim of lab session is for you to understand the basic operations of several libraries for machine 
learning, including **data reading and writing**, **simple classification** and **regression calculations**,  **data visualisation**, and **the calculation of evaluation metrics**. It includes 4 tutorial examples and 3 tasks. You may follow the tutorials to learn the basic function operations and then complete the tasks. 

- Tutorial 01. Pandas
- Tutorial 02. From Pandas to Numpy Array 
- Tutorial 03. Simple visualization of data (some fundamental of matplotlib)
- Task 01. preliminary analysis of datasets 
- Tutorial 04. Performance evaluation
- Task 02. Breast Cancer dataset
- Task 03. California_housing dataset

**Test in Env**
